**Warning**: I watched this a month ago, and I don't remember some parts of the anime.

I'm surprised this anime got such a low rating, maybe the anime community generally dislikes highschool girls talking about ess-ee-ecks? This anime presents the struggles of literature club high school girls (and I guess males?) have against their teenage hormones in a realistic fashion. Some reject the entire idea of finding a partner, some choose alternatives, and some just go for it.

This anime illustrates the self-discovery journey of these highschoolers on discovering their sexuality, devise methods to tackle the pink-tinted lens they now see the world in, and generally just accepting it as a frequent biological impulse due to puberty. This anime is jam-packed full of drama, funny moments, and explores the idea of taboo relationships that will trigger a reflex to contact the police.

To top it off, the final drama will breathtakingly and nicely end the anime, making this anime one of the rare ones that concludes the series properly. You should give this anime a try, even if you don't like the idea of ess-ee-ecks (you will also find out why I'm delibrately using this phrase).

Happy Coding,
