**Warning**: This review was written 1.5 months after I watched it, so I don't remember most of what happened in the series.

That being said though, I remember this being an anticipated Second season. This season wasn't as exciting as the previous season - character development, with the exception of Lilith, was limited. To me, it seems more of a world-building and information-revelation season than a season meant for action. We do get to see some glimpses of Bell being a chad, but it was mainly "oh we got a new house", "Lilith had such a backstory?" and "Hestia is in debt?" (i.e. stuff we already mostly knew).

I get the feeling that this Season is meant to be like this, and the big "stuff" happens in Season 3, so watch this to get the relevant information you need to get hyped for the next season!

Happy Coding,
