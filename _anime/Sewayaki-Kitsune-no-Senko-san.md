You know, growing up sucks. You eventually figure out that no matter what you do, you'll probably end up working for a large corporation, and while on the surface, they seem like they care for you, organizing HR events to ensure you "enjoy your work", in reality, you're just a wage slave.

All your hopes and dreams of one day bringing about change in the world disappears the instant you become an adult; for you are now a wandering consciousness in the sea of consciousness, also wondering what their goal is. In times like this, who do you rely on to shine a light on your path?

For our main character, it seems to be the demigod fox, Senko-san. Being a wage slave in a exploitative company is something I can understand, and so it made me quite envious when the main character had a way to shed his exhaustion - we all need a Senko-san in our lives.

It's a slice of life comedy anime, so just enjoy it on your free time.

Happy Coding,
