With yet another 4 episode flashback of our boi Dazai, this strange character, alongside his backstory filled with the other characters that help progress the plot, "Bungou Stray Dogs 3rd Season" delivers yet another entertaining 12 episodes to watch.

Viewers can yet again enjoy both the action and the fighting downtime, with the same quirks as they had in the 2nd Season. The new character introduced in Season 2 also became more mature in this season, meaning that we have an array of well-developed characters doing serious anime things, which is something very interesting to witness; because you, the viewer, are already aware of their characters, you can kind of predict what they're going to do next, but they'll somehow not stop entertaining you.

A very interesting thing about the Bungou Stray Dogs series thus far: everything is connected. Something introduced in Season 1 can get used in Season 3, which meant that there is no wastage of plot elements from the world-building and character-introduction season.

If you enjoyed Season 2, you'll enjoy season 3.

Happy Coding,
