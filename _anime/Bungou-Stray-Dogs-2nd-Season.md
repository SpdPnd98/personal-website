And _this_ is why I was eventually in love with this series. I'm not going to draw parallels to other animes here, because I feel like this anime deserves to have its own recognition.

Using the characters well-built from the first season, "Bungou Stay Dogs 2nd Season" draws out the qualities that these characters have, and expand them even more, within the first four episodes. The most mysterious person within the anime now has a four-episode flashback, which foreshadowed his contributions to the main character's development and story through his past experiences and connections.

This season really shows how the fundamental concept of abilities (transformations and the like) can be leveraged to create a story that is engaging, and really puts the watcher on the edge of their seats. There is a considerable amount of effort put into keeping the characters as balanced as possible, so that the "action" part of the anime remains fun and exciting to watch - especially the last battle of the season.

This anime is not only just the fighting; tatics were used to make progressing the plot engaging, leveraging characters that are not suitable for combat (or retired from combat) to drive a convincing narrative for certain reactions to thenafter occur. Not many anime can do both at the same time; during fighting downtime, progressing the plot in a meaningful and engaging manner is crucial when creating a complex world that all viewers can understand.

The visuals and sound compliment each other and the story well, so there's not much to complain there.

My recommendation: Watch it, it's pretty good.

Happy Coding,
