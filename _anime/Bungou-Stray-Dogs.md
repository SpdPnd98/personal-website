Even though I binged all three seasons in almost one sitting, I can't help but split the reviews up; it's due to the difference in rating.

Bungo Stray Dogs used an underlying concept used in many animes (transformation), and tries to do something unique with it. As I would like to put it, the first season is simply the world building and character introduction season, where the characters we'll eventually become familiar with are put on stage, to perform their personalities.

What I'm saying probably makes no sense, but that is really what this season is about; sure, there are some plot movement within this season, but I believe that they are miniscule compared to the strides in building the characters. Sprinkling some humor here and there, it helps the viewer to absorb and relate to the charactes on the screen; some come from tough backgrounds, some aren't special, some keep to themselves, some have huge ideals, et. cetera.

There is also a right balance of action that takes place during this season, particularly towards the end of the season, where our main character learns what it is that he wants to be doing, permanently locking his base characteristics for the seasons ahead.

As far as plot goes, it would only have a maximum of half my expectations, because only half the season is really related to the plot. I see (or hear) no issues in the visuals and sound, so the season scores full marks on that end.

Hence, the score of the season. You should watch this if the subsequent reviews catches your eye. Do look out for them, they're this season's sequels :eyes:.

Happy Coding,
