**Warning**: I watched this 1.5 months ago, and am a diehard Fate fan. My reviews will definitely be skewed.

:tada::tada::tada: Finally, finally, finally! My boy finally gets his own anime. This anime is not for those not aware of some Fate lore, although you won't need to know much to watch this anime. If you play [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us/), you will see a familiar face here, one that you never thought you'll see again :wink:.

Excitement aside, "Lord El-Melloi II Case Files: Rail Zeppelin" is fantastic; it follows a man with no talent in magecraft, but became a professor who teaches eccentric apprentices. He is also famous for solving several cases, with his favourite approach being the "whodunit" and "whydunit" approach (google them). In this anime, you follow Lord El-Melloi II as he solves multiple cases and interact with his apprentices, told through great story-teling with appropriate build-ups to exciting moments.

Do give it a go if you are a fan of the Fate franchise!

Happy Coding,
