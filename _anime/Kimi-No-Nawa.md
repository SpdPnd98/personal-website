Now, I'm not a suckler for romance animes. However, this caught my attention, because (a) it aired in a movie theatre nearby and (b) the internet exploded with compliments on its premier.

# Review
Kimi no Na Wa. (not to be confused with Kimi no Nawa) is great; it has good art, sound, direction, flow, and depsite being a movie, the character development is great too. If you like romance anime, then go watch it. If you're not, then you can still watch it; it isn't like the typical romance anime, where a boy and girl instantaneously falls in love on eye contact, or one where they are literally mortal enemies at first but became lovers because the guy showed excessive kindness to the girl. The voice acting is also not forced like many anime, giving the viewers some level of emotive connection with the charcters in the anime.

What the anime does well is emotionally engaging the audience with the relatable characters. Once that is done, the anime forcefully drags the audience through an emotional rollercoaster, with no way of escape except ripping out the heart. Overall, I enjoyed this way more than I expected, and I definitely recommend it.

**note**: This review is created as a test when developing the layout used for the site. I decided to leave it in because it made sense and why not.

Happy coding,
