**Warning**: Wrote this review 1 month after I viewed the anime. I have no idea what I'm talking about, but...

This anime is mediocre at everything. There's nothing exciting, except maybe the first and last episode and some character's lovecraftian origins. There's nothing outstanding to speak about; usually, anime is different in one aspect or the other, but this particular one is just... normal?

I don't know how to explain it, but if you got time to kill, and you really don't want to be wow'd, I guess you can give this anime a shot. But with the plethora of other anime out there, I don't think this anime stands out as being one you must watch.

Happy Coding,
