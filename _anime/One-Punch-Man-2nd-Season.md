It's the second season of One Punch Man, following a character so overpowered that he can clear any monsters with one punch.

Because they took so long to release this season, I read the manga, and so I was a little bit disappointed when this anime came out; it wasn't long enough to cover an entire arc.

As such, treat this as a "part one" season to a two parter, because there's nothing worthy to note for this particular season.

Short review, I know. But that's all I can say.

Happy Coding,
