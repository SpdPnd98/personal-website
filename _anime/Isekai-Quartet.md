Ah yes, this is the anime industry being self-aware of the mountains of Isekai Anime being released this year.

Well, I mean, I guess you can watch this if you want? I've fairly graded it based on my own criterias, but I've got nothing against the anime; it's a fun slice-of-life thing for all the Isekai animes that have come out recently, and I dare say the characters are quite identical (personality-wise) to their fully animated counterparts, so I guess, if nothing's stopping you...

Watch it?

If it's on your watchlist to kill time, go ahead and watch it; it's not bad, neither is it great. (That's why the rating is average :wink:)

Next review :clap:

Happy Coding
