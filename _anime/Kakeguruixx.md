"SA SA SA KAKEGURUI MASHOU!" - Yumeko 2019. Our compulsive gambler takes us to Season 2, where we observe a girl obsessed with gambling willing to risk her everything, including her life, to a gamble, and enjoying the whole process a little bit too much.

Striping away all the complicated plot elements of this season, the fundamental principle of "girl having too much fun gambling everything" is carried forward to the second season; meaning if you enjoyed the first season of Kakegurui, you'll probably enjoy this season too.

As there's not much in the way of story-telling and character development due to the type of anime this is, I'll just evaluate the other factors that make an anime good, and leave you with the decision, whether to watch it or not.

In terms of visuals, it's on par with the previous season; that is to say, crucial parts of the anime are animated really well, bringing out the suspense and confusion (it's supposed to do that, don't worry) whenever necessary. The OST pairs really well with the visuals to also bring out similar emotions.

Erm, in a nutshell, it's an anime about a compulsive gambler; I think that's all I can grade it for. I knocked the rating down from 10 -> 8 because of my personal tastes, otherwise, I don't think I can fault it for anything else; pacing was pretty okay, and because the anime is themed around a school full of gamblers willing to sacrifice their lives, I don't think I can fairly assess how "relatable" it is to me.

So that's that. Watch it if you want.
