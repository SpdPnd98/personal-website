I did not like Season 2 and Season 3 Part 1 of Shingeki no Kyojin. It was getting out of hand, with the whole anti-titan squad going ham and killing stuff, and vice-versa.

However, **this** season; ho boy, things changed. Our three main characters goes through some life-changing events, bringing about character developments, especially on Eren - the boy that you used to know as loud, annoying, and careless? He's gone, he's seen some serious stuff, he's no longer the Eren Jaeger you know.

The plot is finally starting to move, the world is changing, and all characters are starting to sink into despair - some characters have their long-term goals achieved, while others had their hopes and dreams crushed and blended into goop.

Visuals, sound, plot, progression rate, all the ratings are green. You should watch this season; it's the best Shingeki no Kyojin season we had yet.

Happy Coding,
